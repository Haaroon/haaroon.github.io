List of projects I am interested in doing but I am busy with other things. 


## Blockchain attacks

- Graph analytics on-chain - using motifs to find common patterns 
- Doing 51% attacks on live shit-coins
- Defi Trading attacks and vulns 

## Car hacking

- Can bus research
- Car Immobiliser research. How secure are they? e.g. Pandora, Autowatch Ghost II etc. 
- Car tracker research. How does these Cat5 and Cat7 trackers work, how can you disarm them. How can you make them stronger. 

## Flipper Zero

- Can we use the flipper zero to generate legitimate gen II pokemons that we can use to trade to Gen II Pokemon games on the GameBoy Color? 


## How do private email relay services work
