# Bio
I am a third year [Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) 
[PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy) student in
the [Information Security Group](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) at
[UCL (University College London)](http://www.ucl.ac.uk). 
Researching Cryptocurrencies and Underground Markets under the supervision 
of [Dr Sarah Meiklejohn](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Meiklejohn/) (in the past with 
[Professor Jens Groth](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/j.groth/)), supported by 
the [EU 2020 project](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/). 
I am also apart of the [Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3)](http://www.initc3.org/).

My history is as follows, 
I completed a [Masters of Philosophy (MPhil)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Philosophy) 
in [Advanced Computer Science](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/admissions/acs/) at the
[University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/) under supervision of 
[Dr Richard Clayton](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rnc1/). 
My project was on "Discerning Patterns in the Compromise of Websites". I completed an 
undergraduate degree in [Computer Science with Industrial Expereince](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/undergraduate/coursefinder/courses/79923.html) 
at [Queen Mary, University of London](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/). With my thesis under 
the supervision of [Dr Paulo Oliva](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~pbo/).

For my industrial year I worked as a full time technical analyst at
