I work in research at [Pometry](https://www.pometry.com), a startup I co-founded in 2021, with 
my colleague [Ben Steer](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=JaCvFD8AAAAJ&hl=en) & Alhamza Alnaimi both from Queen Mary and James Alford. Our 
specialty is distributed temporal graph analytics, since most platforms are either too slow or 
cannot perform this kind of analysis. Come say hello.  

I also am on the technical committee for the [Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3)](http://www.initc3.org/). We hold bi-annual camps, retreats and research all the good things in blockchain, cryptocurrencies and cryptography! Do check us out. 

Prior to this I graduated with a [Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) 
[PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy) from
the [Information Security Group](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) at
[UCL (University College London)](http://www.ucl.ac.uk). 
Where I researched Investigating transactions in cryptocurrencies under the supervision 
of [Professor Sarah Meiklejohn](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Meiklejohn/) and
[Professor Jens Groth](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/j.groth/), supported by 
the [EU 2020 project](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) and 
the [Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3)](http://www.initc3.org/).

Even before this: 
I completed a [Masters of Philosophy (MPhil)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Philosophy) 
in [Advanced Computer Science](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/admissions/acs/) at the
[University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/) under supervision of 
[Dr Richard Clayton](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rnc1/). 
My project was on "Discerning Patterns in the Compromise of Websites". I completed an 
undergraduate degree in [Computer Science with Industrial Experience](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/undergraduate/coursefinder/courses/79923.html) 
at [Queen Mary, University of London](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/). With my thesis under 
the supervision of [Dr Paulo Oliva](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~pbo/).

For my industrial year I worked as a full time technical analyst at 
[Goldman Sachs](http://www.goldmansachs.com/) where I delivered multiple projects into production.
